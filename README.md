We applied a new machine learning approach to quantify biodiversity changes without requiring temporal survey replication at individual sites. We utilized a database of approximately 0.7 million vegetation plot records from the [European Vegetation Archive (EVA)](https://euroveg.org/eva-database/) sampled across Europe to interpolate the dynamics of community-level plant species richness between 1960 and 2020.

Our spatiotemporal interpolation approach effectively reconstructs biodiversity dynamics. It predicts plant species richness changes with good accuracy (rsq = 0.4) when tested against independent time series data from [ReSurveyEurope](https://euroveg.org/resurvey/). Thus, our method offers a powerful framework for quantifying biodiversity changes in a variety of other contexts.
